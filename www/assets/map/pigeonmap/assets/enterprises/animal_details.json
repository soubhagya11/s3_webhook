They have stubbier legs and a compacted shape for navigating mountainous terrain. Just like you must shorten your stride as you start up a hill, shorter limbs on a mountain zebra keep their balance centered beneath their body. Small, narrow hooves complete their climbing kit, allowing them to find stable gaps between shifting rocks.</p>",
